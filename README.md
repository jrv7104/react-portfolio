# React Portfolio

This is a first attempt at a react portfolio. My goal here was to try to make it look close to my latest portfolio page, but using react elements.

As I said, this is only a first build, and more will definitely be added on. Two things I noticed were using the GitHub and LinkedIn icons and having a consistent header that stays with the page, but only displays that particular content when selected. These are things I'm hoping to improve on as time goes on, and I definitely hope to have more by the time this class ends. It has also been a complete nightmare getting it to run on GitHub pages, and even following documentation has not helped me out at all. It has been a frustrating assignment.
