            Hello, and welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Jason Viox (pronounced Vee-ox), 
            and I have been interested in coding and web development for about a year. I became 
            interested in the field around the time the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and my journalism 
            career was affected by the incident. I left the field after spending a total of 10 
            years in journalism, but that has now allowed me to invest more time in coding.
            </p>

            <p>
            In regards to my coding experience, I started with the CS50 online class through
            Harvard University, but later explored Mimo, a phone app that teaches HTML, JavaScript,
            CSS, SQL and Python. While those lessons have been beneficial, I am currently taking a 
            web development bootcamp through Washington University with the goals of obtaining a full 
            stack certification and starting a new career.
            </p>

            <p>
            Thank you for stopping by. Feel free to contact me for any questions or even just to say hi!
