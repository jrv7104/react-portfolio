        <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Jason Viox (pronounced Vee-ox), and I have been interested in coding and web development for about a year. I became interested in the field around the time the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and my journalism career was affected by the incident. I left the field after spending a total of 10 years in journalism, but that has now allowed me to invest more time in coding.</p>
        <p>In regards to my coding experience, I started with the CS50 online class through Harvard University, but later explored Mimo, a phone app that teaches HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SQL and Python. While those lessons have been beneficial, I recently  graduated from a coding and web development bootcamp through Washington University. I accomplished one of my biggest goals by graduating from the program and earning my certificate of completion. Now I am working towards my next goal of starting a new career in coding and web development.</p>
        <p>Thank you for stopping by. Feel free to contact me for any questions or even just to say hi!</p>
